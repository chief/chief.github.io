## My hands



my hands are dirty my soul like a never opened door  
what 've i done wrong don't know i just try to ignore



seems like i am trapped in the phrase job-home-job  
and the things i want to do are clearly...don't know

once i feel it but now the magic maybe is gone  
it's a secret strength the power of the soul

you have it you can do a lot   
you lost it try find it fore too late

so here i sit alone and cry for my lost soul  
cause i cannot find the key to myself (vres kati allo)  
strange situation can't feel too much  
cannot feel cannot feel
