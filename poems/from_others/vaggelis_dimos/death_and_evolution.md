## Death and evolution

Stranded on the sands of time  
Drowning in a cesspool  
victims in vicious circles  
of death and evolution

Nothing but a pale face  
the bitter taste of every day  
without sun without mirth  
we strive to survive

it's all about  
Death and evolution

when everything falls apart  
find your way and make your stand  
You'll never see a brighter sun  
But dont let them drag you down in their mud
