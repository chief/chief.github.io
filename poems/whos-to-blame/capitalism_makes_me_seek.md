## Capitalism makes me seek

Walking down out of mind and heart  
what I live now, is it truth or lie?  
so many people are hiding their pain,  
mending illness with their greed and gain

And my movements are controlled by invisible hands  
motionless, I 'm waiting for the end to come

My dreams are confused and paralyzed  
in the name of profit sacrificed  
do anything but I can't escape  
and it does not seem to change the trail

The sun has already set in the palms of my hands
