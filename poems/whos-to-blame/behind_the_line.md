## Behind the line

how does it feel to be in this empty place?  
called it army or school sanatorium or prison  
uniformity and commands, discipline and attitude's check  
Waste of time and routine a personality's rape  

all the same / in one form  
one step right, two steps wrong  
always behind the line  

Jailers hold keys, teachers lock our minds  
Generals load, soldiers pull triggers  
tv screens offer tranquillity  
distort reality  

Iâ€™d better run instead of watching them try  
building and shaping my mind, another square-man  
I dont need your dots, your lines, your forms, shapes, your lies  
your news, your taste, your wars, your fucking square mind  

all the same in one form  
one step right, two steps wrong  
always behind the line
