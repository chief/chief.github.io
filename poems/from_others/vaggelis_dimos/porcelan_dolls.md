## Porcelain Dolls

* __couple 1__

To live inside these white walls

to get you high through a constant fall

Hearing the screams of pain at night

Is this the way to make things right?

* __refren__

when ideals collapse

You ask me what do I really see

What brought us at the edge?

From where should I begin?

* __couple 2__

More cheap drugs for a cheap living

reinventing our brand new deceiving

When white is the only colour you see

A porcelain doll,is all you left to be

* __outro__

Straight to paranoia and alienation
