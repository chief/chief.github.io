## Some people believe they are the center of the universe

I wanna dance in Dubai land  
when castles fall down to dust  
I wanna stand and make a wish  
when yuppies die in the Wall Street  

Liars you are small dots  

Wind blows and you are gone

I wanna drink a bottle of wine  
when bankers are drown in debts and die  
I wanna run upon your cars  
when there is no oil there is no gas
