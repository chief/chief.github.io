## Absent Mind

try to remember who's knocking the door  
why i am afraid so why i am alone  
Many shadows squat my dirty floor  

strange puppet surround my thoughts  
look at me in this funny show  
playing a role that i do not know  

why am i laughing i can't explain  
all my feelings are painted grey  
confusion covers my whole brain  

give me a reason to stay calm  
a reason why I 'm so blind  
and maybe one day I 'll change my mind  

remain in this shell  
start to spell my name  
a whisper is heard  
sounds like destroy  

white and black, life and death  
hate and love , hold my breath  
I m sinking, I am lost  

truth and lies , nightmare dreams  
light in dark , silence screams  
mercy, i am dead  

why am i laughing i can't explain  
All my feelings are painted grey  
confusion covers my whole brain  

who's to blame i cannot say  
maybe it's me so i scream my name  
From now on nothing will be the same  

remain in this shell  
start to spell my name  
a whisper is heard  
sounds like destroy  

Life,  lies that you feed my brain  
are turning to a rope around my neck
