## Self destruct

Dirty clowns serve the wine  
See a joker infects your mind  
Dizzy ragged and drunk with envy  
Seeking balance on the ground  

Delude with empty hopes  
By stabbing in the back  
Point the finger and accuse  
What they don't understand  

feel like falling, no one catches you  
but in the meantime, you want to make me a fool  
feel like crushing, again you miss the point  
no salvation, for this human world  

Greed and lust  
Hands on mud  
Rotten eyes  

Greed and lust  
Self destruct  
Civilized
