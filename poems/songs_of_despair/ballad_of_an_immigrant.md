## Ballad of an immigrant

I am sick here in greece  
I can't smile cannot sleep  
I am sick to death  
Î™ am stuck in athens hell

Black clouds (are) coming  
trees are leaving  
the seas are turning red

Only rivers are singing songs   
"Go away little son"   
Only rivers are singing songs  
"We will meet when winter ends" 

Black clouds (are) coming  
trees are leaving  
the seas are turning red  

Only rivers are crying out  
"follow the birds from the south"  
Only rivers are crying out  
"till the winter goes out"
