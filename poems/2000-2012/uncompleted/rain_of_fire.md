## Rain of fire

come on rain and wash my face  
there is so much pain now

come on rain and wash my feet  
clean my body and my hands  
there are so dirty

find the best perfums that you have  
and dress me with green leaves

come on rain and take my hand  
I need no wind no moon no sun

I think I'm scared but no last word  
I' m gonna tell

Cause I feel my time will come

I 'm the one that people hate  
I' m Life but become their slave

My body is full of wounds  
all my fingers were cut

I lost my hair but toxic gas  
I' trapped into nuclear land

No life is for me  
No life is for you

But please before I die  
Come on rain - wash me

And if you can't do   
can't do even that

Make rain your water fire  
and burn me slowly

Just throw my ashes to the air  
Don't want to see people again ...
