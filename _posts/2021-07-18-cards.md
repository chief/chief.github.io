A gun a chair a table some cards

when I was young I had other plans

A bullet myself a beer some cards

now I am too old to do otherwise

<br/>
A sound a dead-man a glass a dead-man

A sound a dead-man some cards

you gonna use what’s in your hands

<br/>
Silence dark dust some cards

we are here only by chance

Silence dark dust some cards

we are here only by chance

<br/>
A rustle a light dust some cards

life starts to spin around
