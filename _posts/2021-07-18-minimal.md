how can a screen feed a child that dies

can a friend in your page hear your cries

a satellite guides guides your way

satellite guides guides your way

<br/>
through life

<br/>
why do I need one hundred clicks to smile

and how better will my life be

after all I ’ve never found

although I ’ve been searching around

after all I ‘ve never found

in so many goods

happiness

no happiness
