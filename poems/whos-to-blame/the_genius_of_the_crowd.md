## The Genius of the crowd

beware the preachers, the knowers  
those who are always reading books  
those who either detest poverty

beware those quick to praise  
for they need praise in return  
those who are quick to censor

they are afraid of what they do not know  
beware those who seek constant

beware those who seek constant crowds  
for they are nothing alone  
beware the average man

their love is average, (seeks) average  
but there is genius in their hatred  
enough genius in their hatred

to kill kill anybody  
not not wanting solitude  
not understanding solitude

like a shining diamond  
(like) a knife  
(like) a mountain  
(like) a tiger  
like hemlock  
their finest art  

they will attempt to destroy anything  
that differs from their own  
not being able to create art

they will not understand art  
they will consider their failure as  
creators only as a failure of the world

they will believe  
your love incomplete  
and (then) they will hate you

and (then) they will hate you  
and their hatred 'll be perfect  
and (then) they will hate you
