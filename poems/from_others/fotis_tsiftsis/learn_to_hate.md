## Learn to Hate

all our stories like rats in alleys

fallen asleep in death valleys

wise wind turns the pages of news

hear me silently yelling

what exactly am i selling

just a clone of myself

am i burried in a cell

did you see me slipping down the hill?

did you hear me protesting of being ill?
