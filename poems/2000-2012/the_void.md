## The void

nothing is proper nothing is new  
she said to me and cry  
I'm gonna leave this life  
and start a new one, oh I don't lie  

I'll erase my friends from my mind  
They treat me like a trash  
I' ll find a new job  
And stop what i used to do,  
oh that's true 

Hey my friend tell me the truth  
I think something you said is wrong  
Hey my friend don't lie to me  
I think nothing you said is right

Whenever you go what you 'll do   
what people you 'll find   
the same problems you 'll face,(I know)  
the same sorrow you 'll have 

Cause the problem is in your mind   
There is a bug deep in your soul   
And when I'm looking inside into your dry eyes   
I only see the void ....
