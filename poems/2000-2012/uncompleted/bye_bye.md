## Bye Bye


i want to have a lot of money  
i want to buy a new TV  
new versions of computers programs  
and some hi-fi CD

i want to buy i want to buy  
good buy my sufferings  
i want to buy i want to buy  
good bye my happiness  
it's good (to) sell my happiness

i want to have 100 shoes  
just in case of one rainy day  
i want to have and two tatooes  
to remember that comfusing day

i want to buy i want to buy  
good buy my sufferings  
i want to buy i want to buy  
good bye my happiness  
it's good sell my happiness  

I want to buy three four cars  
amplifiers bass and drums  
i want to buy mobile phones  
to send messages to my own 

i want to buy i want to buy  
good buy my sufferings  
i want to buy i want to buy  
good bye my happiness  
it's good sell my happiness

// i want to take
