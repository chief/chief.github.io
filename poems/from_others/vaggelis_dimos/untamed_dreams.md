## Untamed Dreams or Save your last breath

Do your untamed dreams fit  
in a tamed world of grayness?  
Where desires are sterilized  
in a heaven made of plastic?

when your (burning) spirit will reach things  
beyond murk and doubt,   
collect your feelings and make a fist  
break this (goddamn) world,this dying beast
 
And save your last breath for the day  
(the day) you will walk this earth again  
standing tall like a man,like a woman  
not like a fearful slave

not a fearful slave
