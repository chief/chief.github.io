all our stories like rats in alleys
fallen asleep in death valleys
wise wind turns the pages of (news)

As we grow up, one by one
our dreams they die
we are left with nothing

In the land of a dying sun
a dawn of hope never comes
In the land of a dying sun

* The wind of emptiness blows
  hard on these dark times
  but we won't decay in the
  grayness of everyday life


We won't bury our dreams in the ground
