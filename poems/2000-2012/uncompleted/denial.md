## Denial

i deny all of you with big words in your mouth  
i deny all of you with no feelings in your eyes  
i deny all of you who cannot hear my cries  
i deny all of you who cannot feel the touch  
i deny only you who betray the taste of love

i see   
no   
no  
communication  

i see  
no   
will for   
communication  

i ask  
what   
what else   
can we do  

we   
walk in  
sepatare  
road lifes  

and  
or   
we   
must stay  
in lines  

but   
why  
why
