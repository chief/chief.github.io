## Generation

this generation ate the fruits of denial  
Tasted the strychnine, killed on the roads  
Magnetized by the light of TV  
Bitten by dogs,shot by the guards  

My generation crushed to the rock  
Left behind where there is no way out  
It was deceived by intellectual's caste  

Pieces of puzzle that they call life  
What a wonderful world, what is the price?  
All i see is suffering  
why must we suffer?  

This generation consumed and betrayed  
Hold flags of hate  
singing again a monotonous song  
Begged for a job  

My generation breath rotten air  
in misery towns a misery life  
in misery towns a misery life  
in misery towns dies
